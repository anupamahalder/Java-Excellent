# Java
### High Level to Low Level:
*Source Code* --> *Byte Code* --> *Object Code* <br><br>
From source code we have .java file extension. Then we do compile means transforming source code to machine code.
In byte code we get .class file extension after compling source code. Using JVM which translate as part of the run process we get our Object code (Machine code).
